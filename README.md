# Brain_Stroke_Prediction
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Brain Stroke Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters. Strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction can be crucial for timely medical intervention.</p>
<br>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project contains various health-related features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, and more. The dataset can be found here.
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
id: Unique identifier
gender: Gender of the patient
age: Age of the patient
hypertension: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
heart_disease: 0 if the patient does not have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
work_type: Type of occupation
residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in blood
bmi: Body mass index
smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 otherwise
<h2>Model Training</h2>
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to find the best performance.
<h3>Algorithms Used</h3>
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbours
