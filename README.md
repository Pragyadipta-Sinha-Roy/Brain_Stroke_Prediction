# Brain_Stroke_Prediction
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Brain Stroke Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters. Strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction can be crucial for timely medical intervention.</p>
<br>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project contains various health-related features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, and more. The dataset can be found here.
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
        <li><strong>id</strong>: Unique identifier</li>
        <li><strong>gender</strong>: Gender of the patient</li>
        <li><strong>age</strong>: Age of the patient</li>
        <li><strong>hypertension</strong>: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension</li>
        <li><strong>heart_disease</strong>: 0 if the patient does not have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease</li>
        <li><strong>ever_married</strong>: "No" or "Yes"</li>
        <li><strong>work_type</strong>: Type of occupation</li>
        <li><strong>residence_type</strong>: "Rural" or "Urban"</li>
        <li><strong>avg_glucose_level</strong>: Average glucose level in blood</li>
        <li><strong>bmi</strong>: Body mass index</li>
        <li><strong>smoking_status</strong>: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"</li>
        <li><strong>stroke</strong>: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 otherwise</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Model Training</h2>
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to find the best performance.
<h3>Algorithms Used</h3>
